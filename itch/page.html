<h1>Ötzit!</h1>
<p>
  <em>South Tyrol. The year is 3300BC.</em> Ötzi &mdash;
  <a href="https://www.iceman.it/en/the-iceman/" target="_blank">the Iceman</a>
  for his friends &mdash; is crossing the border to Austria in search of a quiet
  place to retire after a lifetime of hunting. Forest animals got the word and
  are hellbent on stopping him. He needs your help to fend them off and avoid
  getting stampeded.
</p>
<h2>How to play</h2>
<p>
  You must quickly type the falling words and help Ötzi along his difficult
  path.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>In addition to the usual letter keys, you will need a few more:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>ENTER</code> (<kbd>↩</kbd>) confirms a word,</li>
  <li><code>BACKSPACE</code> (<kbd>⟵</kbd>) deletes a letter,</li>
  <li><code>SHIFT</code> (<kbd>⇧</kbd>) uppercases a letter,</li>
  <li><code>ESCAPE</code> (<kbd>Esc</kbd>) pauses the game.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  <strong>Warning:</strong> to play on desktop you will need a German keyboard.
</p>
<p>
  Some knowledge of German may help, but it's not necessary. It's far more
  important to have some familiarity with the
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraktur" target="_blank"
    >Fraktur script</a
  >
  you will be reading. By the way, here's the alphabet:

<h2>Technical information</h2>
<p>
  This is a custom purpose game developed by the Institute of Applied
  Linguistics at Eurac Research for the
  <a href="https://all4ling.eurac.edu/projects/zeitshift/" target="_blank"
    >Zeit.shift project</a
  >. Zeit.shift has digitised approximately 500,000 pages of historical Tyrolean
  newspapers, and seeks to promote access to these digital collections through
  the development of games, activities, as well as an e-learning course.
</p>
<p>
  Ötzit! primarily targets German-speaking players in the 11-14 age group but is
  open to all casual gamers alike. The goal of the game is to increase
  players&apos; awareness of the digitised newspaper collections, their ability
  to read historical documents written in Gothic script (<em>Fraktur</em>) and
  their knowledge of Tyrolean history.
</p>
<p>
  All data anonymously contributed by the players (i.e. typed words) is analysed
  and used by the project to research automated means of crowdsourcing OCR
  corrections and improve the searchability of the digitised collections.
