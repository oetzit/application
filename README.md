# Ã–tzi

This is a web-based typing game.

## Backend

The backend is a `fastify` webserver exposing some APIs.

To spin it up for development,

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm exec knex migrate:latest
npm exec knex seed:run
PORT=8080 npm run serve
```

The webserver will be abailable at `http://localhost:8080`.

## Frontend

The frontend is a `phaser` webapp built `parcel`.

To spin it up for development,

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run serve
```

Also, remember to

    Change line 63/64 of main.js file in src/js folder by switching the comment.
    This operation permits the ui to call the backend at `http://localhost:8080/oetzi_words/` instead of to the relative path.

The webapp will be abailable at `http://localhost:1234`.

## Deployment

```bash
# Please validate before deploying (note the cluster is 1.10.11 but 1.11.0 is the nearest one that works):
kustomize build backend/k8s/overlays/ENV/ | kubeval --kubernetes-version 1.11.0
# We're on an old version and there's no -k flag:
kustomize build backend/k8s/overlays/ENV/ | kubectl apply -f -
```
